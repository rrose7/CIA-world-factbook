# CIA-world-factbook
In this project, we'll work with data from the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/" > CIA World Factbook </a>. The Factbook contains demographic information like: population-The population as of 2015, population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage and Area -The total land and water area.
We got the data from the github repo. Data can be found at <a href="https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql/releases " >repo </a>. We visualized the data using the histogram.
